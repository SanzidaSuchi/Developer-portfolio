            <p>My occupation of choice is web designer, and I chose this because even though I don’t know everything
                about
                computers I am very fast at learning about them. It’s never too late to start this occupation and I know
                if
                I put time and effort into this\ I know I will love it and I can be good at it. As a web designer I will
                create and keep up with websites, including the layout, and function according to the client. (Web
                Developer) Web designing has really developed over time ever since the “World Wide Web” was created and
                it
                has visually improved as well as the speed and mobility.</p>
